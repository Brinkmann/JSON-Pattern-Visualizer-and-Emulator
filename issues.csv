"1. Decide tech stack","Evaluate potential programming languages and frameworks (e.g., React+TS, Vanilla JS+Canvas, Python). Consider browser vs desktop. Document final decision.","Visualiser Emulator Dev Board"
"2. Decide visualisation approach","Compare Canvas, SVG, WebGL/Three.js. Select the rendering method for cone animation. Document reasoning.","Visualiser Emulator Dev Board"
"3. Analyse JSON examples","Review all JSON examples from Exercises 01–05. Extract shared structure of phases → nodes → colours → secs. Create draft schema.","Visualiser Emulator Dev Board"
"4. Define user stories","Document key user stories for loading JSON, viewing patterns, adjusting playback, debugging, and layout editing.","Visualiser Emulator Dev Board"
"5. Define emulator architecture","Create diagrams covering: JSON Loader, Parser, Timing Engine, Renderer, UI Controls, and Layout Layer. Document folder structure.","Visualiser Emulator Dev Board"
"6. Research animation/timing libraries","Investigate libraries to support animation loops and timing accuracy. Summarise findings and decisions.","Visualiser Emulator Dev Board"
"7. Define cone placement strategy","JSON does not include positions. Define exercise-driven placement rules, presets, and manual drag-and-drop adjustment.","Visualiser Emulator Dev Board"
"8. Set up development environment","Install tools, create initial project structure, verify Hello World, and document setup steps.","Visualiser Emulator Dev Board"
"9. Decide hosting/deployment","Evaluate GitHub Pages, Vercel, Netlify, Firebase. Choose deployment method. Document steps.","Visualiser Emulator Dev Board"
"10. Load and parse JSON","Allow users to upload/paste JSON. Validate structure. Display parsed data or friendly errors.","Visualiser Emulator Dev Board"
"11. Render cones using exercise layout","Implement layout presets (4-corners, lines, grid). Display cones according to exercise description. Add drag-and-drop.","Visualiser Emulator Dev Board"
"12. Animate cone colours","Implement timing engine. Animate cone colours based on JSON secs and phases. Support multi-phase patterns.","Visualiser Emulator Dev Board"
"13. Playback controls","Add Play, Pause, Restart buttons. Playback must be reliable and easy to understand.","Visualiser Emulator Dev Board"
"14. Highlight current phase","Show current phase number and highlight in UI. Update during playback transitions.","Visualiser Emulator Dev Board"
"15. Playback speed control","Add speed options (0.5x, 1x, 1.5x, 2x). Must not break animation timing.","Visualiser Emulator Dev Board"
"16. Timeline bar","Add a clickable timeline showing phases. Highlight current phase. Jump to any phase.","Visualiser Emulator Dev Board"
"17. Handle invalid JSON","Detect missing fields, invalid colours, unknown node IDs. Show friendly error messages.","Visualiser Emulator Dev Board"
"18. Layout presets","Add common exercise presets: corner setup, parallel lines, rows, grids. Allow manual override.","Visualiser Emulator Dev Board"
"19. Dark/light mode","Add theme toggle. Ensure UI readability.","Visualiser Emulator Dev Board"
"20. Export/import configuration","Allow export of layout + JSON + playback settings. Allow full re-import.","Visualiser Emulator Dev Board"
"21. Phase summary panel","Display summary of each phase: colours used, durations, node activity. Useful for debugging.","Visualiser Emulator Dev Board"
"22. Deploy public version","Deploy emulator to hosting platform. Add link in README. Show version number in UI.","Visualiser Emulator Dev Board"
"23. Collect feedback and future backlog","Run review session. Collect improvement ideas. Create new issues for the next phase.","Visualiser Emulator Dev Board"
