# JSON-Pattern-Visualizer-and-Emulator
A lightweight visual tool that brings EyeQ JSON light patterns to life on-screen. Load a sequence, view cone colours and timings in real time, and refine patterns instantly without flashing the ESP32. Fast, simple, and ideal for testing smart-cone behaviour before going pitch-side.
